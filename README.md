## About  

[NETTRASH.GEO](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nettrash-geo/id1463358981?l=ru&ls=1) is an application for tracking current geographical characteristics, such as location (coordinates), altitude according to satellite readings and calculated by the current atmospheric pressure indicator.  

Additionally, information about current weather and geocoding data on the ground is available in the application.  

And the most interesting, the application saves the parameter data locally on the device, allowing you to watch their change over time in graphical form.
